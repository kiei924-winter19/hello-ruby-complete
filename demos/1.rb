# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located.
# ruby 1.rb

# In Ruby, there are different *types* of things:

# Numbers
puts 2
puts 5

# Strings
puts "Hello, world!"

# We can do simple math
puts 2 + 5

# We can even add strings together
puts "Ruby is " + "fun"

# Typing things again and again sucks, so we have the ability to store things
# away, using variables
x = 10
y = 3
puts x * y

# We can give variables any names we want, as long as we don't use spaces
# or any weird characters. For the most part, we just use lowercase letters:
name = "Brian"
weather = "Hot and humid"

# Variable naming is very important. It's an art, almost. We like to name
# things so that it makes sense to whomever is working on your code in the
# future, whether that's you or someone else on your team. In Ruby, we
# typically separate multiple words with an underscore (_)
first_name = "Brian"
current_weather_conditions = "Hot and humid"
